# Description: 

- I analyzed Yelp data related to business star ratings, review ratings, any trends/patterns, etc. The files are in JSON format so I used Python to parse them before exporting them to CSV files, and then I loaded the files to MySQL database. 
- Attached to this repos is my Python scripts to parse JSON files and load CSV files to database, SQL queries and explanation of output.
